07f0ab4f-d4b5-5f10-bbe1-dc0543149954,Incorrect Advice to Customers: Introduction,"HMRC is responsible for a significant number of taxes, duties, contributions, credits and other services. Our customers sometimes need advice from us to get their affairs right. Case-specific advice can be

in writing, such as a clearance or a ruling after a compliance event
face-to-face
by phone.

It includes any instance where we advise a customer about a specific aspect of their tax affairs.
In the vast majority of cases the advice we give will be correct, but there will be occasions when we make a mistake and give incorrect advice.
This guidance is to help you decide when HMRC is bound by incorrect case-specific advice. It does not cover any other circumstances where we might give misleading advice, such as an incorrect public notice. If you think a customer has been misled by incorrect or misleading published guidance, you should contact the relevant technical advice team for further information.
Any reference in this guidance to tax or taxes includes all of the taxes, duties, contributions, credits etc for which HMRC is responsible, but see below for exceptions to this.
The terms remit and remission are used throughout this guidance to refer to both repaying tax wrongly paid or declared, and forgoing collection of tax which should have been paid or declared and has not.
There are special rules for cases relating to overdeclaration claims in indirect taxes. Please see ADML1500.
If your case concerns customs duties or import VAT, you must consult Notice 199 or Customs Directorate before making any remission.
For guidance on certain statutory clearances and approvals, see the information at clearances and approvals provided for in the Taxes Acts

95e3ea94-e4b4-57a9-a91b-842ed30eecb0,Incorrect Advice to Customers: Collection and management,"HMRC’s duty to apply the law correctly
The Commissioners for Revenue & Customs are charged by Parliament with collecting or paying and managing all of the taxes formerly the responsibility of HM Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue, including tax credits and National Insurance. The Department has a duty to collect the correct amount of tax as required by statute and has limited powers to decide to do otherwise.
The Commissioners have some limited discretion with regard to this collection and management, under section 5 of the Commissioners for Revenue & Customs Act 2005, but can only forgo the collection of taxes if this would obtain a higher net return for the national exchequer (for example, if it would cost £500 to collect tax of £50, forgoing the tax in question increases the overall yield by reducing the cost of collection). This principle has been expressed in a number of tax cases, most notably Wilkinson-v-Commissioners of Inland Revenue in the Court of Appeal 2003.

Legitimate Expectation
In some cases, HMRC might act in such a way that it leads a person to believe he is acting correctly when in law he is not. In this situation, the person might be entitled to rely on the advice he received from HMRC. The person has a ‘legitimate expectation’ that HMRC will treat him in a certain way and is protected by the courts on the basis that the principles of fairness, proportionality, predictability and certainty should not be disregarded. This manual deals only with situations arising from incorrect specific advice given to individual taxpayers and businesses. If you have a case concerning any other aspect of legitimate expectation, please contact TADPol1 team using the guidance form for further advice.
The starting point for all cases is that HMRC is not bound by any advice it gives which is incorrect in law. However, in some instances which will be outlined in more detail later in this manual, HMRC might be bound by such incorrect advice, especially if we are able to apply discretion under our powers of collection and management. Please see ADML1300 for the tests to apply to decide if HMRC is bound by incorrect advice.
In all circumstances, where we have given incorrect advice, we must correct the position for the future. See ADML2000 for more detail.

Obligations on HMRC as a public body
HMRC also has a duty under public law to treat taxpayers fairly. There will be some circumstances in relation to incorrect advice in which the courts would rule that to apply the strict letter of the law would be so unfair as to amount to an abuse of power. However, the circumstances need to be exceptional for a court to consider our conduct to be an abuse of power.

10e1791f-2d15-58f7-abd4-88c5983747aa,Incorrect Advice to Customers: When incorrect advice can be binding,"HMRC is only bound by incorrect advice in circumstances where all of the following tests are met:
The customer made it plain he or she was seeking fully considered advice and indicated what it would be used forThe customer provided all information relevant to the queryThe advice given by HMRC was clear, unambiguous and without qualificationThe customer acted in reliance on the advice (i.e. he or she did or refrained from doing something as a direct consequence of the advice)The customer would suffer detriment if the correct statutory position were applied; (e.g. he would be financially worse off than if the correct advice had been given in the first place)To apply the correct statutory position would be so unfair as to constitute an abuse of power (see ADML1400).
A customer can only suffer detriment if he or she is subject to real harm or loss. It is not sufficient to merely suffer disappointment or upset.
These are stretching tests for which there will not always be direct or conclusive evidence. If necessary a reasoned judgement should be made on the balance of probabilities.
If you feel that these tests are met, a higher net return to the Exchequer might be achieved by sticking with the tax treatment of the incorrect advice for the past. Each case must be considered on its own merits. You must keep a record of your decisions reached in such cases and the factors taken into consideration. If you are in any doubt please contact  TADPol1 team using the guidance form for further advice.

25567f1d-c46a-585c-92d8-51c797ab708c,Incorrect Advice to Customers: Detriment,"In all cases where a customer has received incorrect advice, it is important to examine the facts in light of the points in ADML1300. The starting point for all considerations must be that the courts will seek to apply the law, in other words HMRC should collect the correct amount of tax unless there are compelling reasons to not do so. This might be difficult or embarrassing for HMRC, but there are only specific and limited circumstances in which HMRC can exercise some discretion.
One of the tests to be applied is to consider if the correct application of the law would result in detriment to the taxpayer. If so, especially if this seriously affects the customer’s livelihood or business, and it is more likely that the courts would regard a correct application of the law as so unfair that it would be an abuse of our power, though the other conditions in ADML1300 must also be met. We would therefore be bound by our incorrect advice for the past, whilst ensuring the law is applied correctly for the future.
The taxpayer must suffer real and significant detriment before HMRC can regard itself as bound by incorrect advice.

If you are unsure you should seek further advice from other guidance or the relevant technical adviser.
Please refer to the link in ADML1100 for statutory clearances and approvals.
Cases involving overdeclared VAT are subject to separate statute and must not be considered using this guidance alone. For such cases, you must also consult VAT Refunds Manual or TALA.
Similar provisions apply to other indirect taxes and for any cases where a customer claims to have made overdeclarations or overpayaments in these areas you must consult the appropriate guidance or technical advisors.
If your case concerns customs duties or import VAT, you must consult Notice 199 or National Duty Repayment Centre before making any remission.
